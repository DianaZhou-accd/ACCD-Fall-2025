    <h1>Millet</h1>
    <pre>My dogâ€™s name is Millet. She is already twelve years old and has been with me since I was in elementary school.
She is very clingy, probably because I can only go home for four months each year, which makes her stick to me even more.
Every time I return home, she gets so excited to greet me.
But since she is already old for a dog, her excitement often makes her cough.
Whenever I am abroad, I worry about her a lot every year.</pre>
