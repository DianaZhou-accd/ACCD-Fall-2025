    <h3>Quotes from Programming Design systems: Introduction:</h3>
    <p>“Many graphic design schools have resorted to teaching a waterfall philosophy where students are positioned to think of themselves as creatives who come up with ideas for others to build.” I agree, many art schools separate coding and design, except ui/ux students. Students are often trained to focus on visual ideas, form, and aesthetics, but are rarely encouraged to understand how their designs actually function within digital systems. Courses that teach coding, interface design, or interactive prototyping are often treated as optional or peripheral, rather than integral to the design process. I believe that learning coding is a very good choice to expand and enrich the ideas of art students, not limited to static expressions.

    “I have chosen to publish this book for free online without a publisher. The main reason for this is freedom. It allows me to write and design the type of book that I would read.”  A super kind person…</p>

    <h3>Quotes from Programming Design systems: What is a Design system?:</h3>
    <p>“Let us suppose I am asked to design a label for a local brewery’s famous stout beer. I want to make sure that my design is a good fit for the product, so I spend a lot of time researching and tasting the beer before making my final design. The brewery loves my new design, and they ask me to design labels for the rest of their 10 beer types. Now I am faced with a problem. The colors, typography, and illustrations I chose for my label design was a great fit for a strong and dense beer, but it will not work for the other beers. So I end up creating labels with a different visual style for each beer, but without a consistent branding for the brewery.” I always have the same problem during the design process. When I created works based on a single event or object using focus, I was always able to design them. However, when I needed to design a series of works, these series never seemed to be interrelated.

    “This problem could have been avoided had I designed the first label with the conviction that it would be a part of something bigger: A design system for the brewery. Instead of focusing on the particular stout, I would have defined a range of visual styles to be used for different beer types. This would include a set of related typefaces and colors with enough variance to be used for the individual beers, but recognizable enough to provide a common identity for the brewery. Only after creating this design system would I design the first label.” This is such a good solution to solve these problems. I will learn from his advice.</p>

    <h3>Quotes from What do Prototypes Prototype?:</h3>
    <p>“The model shown in Figure 1 represents a threedimensional space which corresponds to important aspects of the design of an interactive artifact. We define the dimensions of the model as role; look and feel; and implementation. Each dimension corresponds to a class of questions which are salient to the design of any interactive system. “Role” refers to questions about the function that an artifact serves in a user’s life—the way in which it is useful to them. “Look and feel” denotes questions about the concrete sensory experience of using an artifact—what the user looks at, feels and hears while using it. “Implementation” refers to questions about the techniques and components through which an artifact performs its function—the “nuts and bolts” of how it actually works. The triangle is drawn askew to emphasize that no one dimension is inherently more important than any other.” Divide any design issues (regardless of their scale) into three categories. Each category requires a different prototype method. Clearly define the design issues to be addressed, assist designers in deciding on the type of prototype, and visually represent the exploration focus of the prototype. I like the triangle of these three elements, which is very clear and easy to understand and be remembered.
        
    “Define “prototype” broadly. Efficient prototypes produce answers to their designers’ most important questions in the least amount of time. Sometimes very simple representations make highly effective prototypes: e.g., the pizza-box prototype of an architect’s computer [Example 10] and the storyboard notebook [Example 1]. We define a prototype as any representation of a design idea—regardless of medium; and designers as the people who create them—regardless of their job titles.” Very helpful advice. These suggestions directly address the core problems that designers encounter in prototype communication and decision-making. They emphasize the need to inform the audience in advance about "what the prototype explores and what it does not explore", to avoid misunderstandings caused by the "non-self-explanatory" nature of the prototype.</p>
